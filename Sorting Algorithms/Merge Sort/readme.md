The code I provided is an implementation of the merge sort algorithm in C++. It sorts an array of integers in ascending order.

The code starts by defining a function called merge_sort which takes two arguments: an integer array arr and its size n. The function is responsible for dividing the array into two halves, sorting each half and then merging them back into a single sorted array.

The function starts by checking the size of the array. If the size is less than or equal to 1, the array is considered to be sorted and the function returns. If the size of the array is greater than 1, the array is divided into two halves, and the function is recursively called on each half to sort them.

After sorting both halves, a function called merge is used to merge the two sorted arrays back into a single sorted array. The merge function takes four arguments: two integer arrays left and right and their sizes left_size and right_size. It compares the first element of each array and adds the smaller one to the result array. This is repeated until all elements from both arrays have been added to the result array.

Finally, the main function initializes a vector of integers and passes it to the merge_sort function along with its size. The sorted vector is then displayed to the console.

The merge sort algorithm has a time complexity of O(n*log(n)) which is efficient for larger arrays.
