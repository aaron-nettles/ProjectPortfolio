Changes made based on Version:


0: lesson page was created and functional. The data from the saved lesson page is displayed after view lesson is clicked.
2.0: The ability to pause, play and restart have been fixed. The iOS device doesn't have playback options for the video but the android does. This will need to be fixed or see if there is a workaround for this issue.
----- anything before this the android upload button didn't work ---------
2.1: fixed issues with Android simulator crashing after the upload button is clicked on the device. Issue had to do with dependancies needed to be installed.
