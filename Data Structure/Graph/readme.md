This code creates a Graph class with functions to add a vertex and an edge to the graph, and a function to display the vertices and their neighbors. The code demonstrates the use of the Graph class by creating an instance, adding vertices and edges, and displaying the graph. The graph is implemented as an adjacency list, where each vertex has a vector of pointers to its neighbors.
