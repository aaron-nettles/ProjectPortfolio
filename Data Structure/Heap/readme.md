This is a C++ program that implements a min heap data structure using a vector. 

The Heap class has methods to insert an element, extract the root element (the minimum value in the case of a min heap), get the size of the heap, and get the root element of the heap. 

The heap is maintained by calling the "heapifyUp" method after an insertion and the "heapifyDown" method after a removal. 

The "main" function demonstrates the usage of the Heap class by creating a min heap and inserting some elements, then extracting the root and printing it.
