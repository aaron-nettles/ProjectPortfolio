The code contains a class Stack that implements the stack data structure. The stack is implemented using a vector elements to store its elements. The class provides the following functions:

bool isEmpty(): This function returns true if the stack is empty, and false otherwise.

void push(int element): This function pushes an element onto the stack.

int pop(): This function pops an element from the stack. If the stack is empty, the function returns -1 and prints an error message.

int top(): This function returns the top element of the stack. If the stack is empty, the function returns -1 and prints an error message.

The main function demonstrates how to use the stack class. The function creates an instance of the Stack class, pushes elements onto the stack, pops elements from the stack, and gets the top element of the stack.

Conclusion
This implementation of a stack in C++ provides a basic understanding of how to implement a stack data structure in C++. The code can be used as a starting point for more complex stack implementations or for learning purposes.
