This code implements a Hash Table data structure in C++. The hash table is implemented using an array of linked lists and uses a hash function to calculate the index of the array where an element should be inserted.

The hash table contains the following main functions:

addEntry(int key, int value): Adds a key-value pair to the hash table.
getValue(int key): Gets the value associated with the given key.
deleteEntry(int key): Deletes the entry with the given key from the hash table.
