The code contains a class Queue that implements the queue data structure. The class provides the following functions:

bool isEmpty(): This function returns true if the queue is empty and false otherwise.

void enqueue(int element): This function adds an element to the end of the queue.

int dequeue(): This function removes an element from the front of the queue. If the queue is empty, it returns -1 and prints an error message.

int front(): This function returns the front element of the queue. If the queue is empty, it returns -1 and prints an error message.

The main function demonstrates the use of the Queue class. The function creates an instance of the class, adds elements to the queue, removes elements from the queue, and gets the front element of the queue.

Conclusion
This implementation of a queue in C++ provides a basic understanding of how to implement a queue data structure in C++. The code can be used as a starting point for more complex queue implementations or for learning purposes.
